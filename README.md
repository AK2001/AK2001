## Hi there 👋

I am a Python developer, focusing on Machine Learning & Deep Learning.

On my free time, I try to touch grass 😎

---

🔭 **I’m currently working on**:
- A mobile app which utilizes Deep Learning to perform multimodal similarity search
- A beginner-friendly tutorial on Neural Networks
- Developing two custom LLMs
- [My blog ヽ༼ ◕_◕༽ﾉ](https://akelaiditis.bearblog.dev/)

### 🏗️ Portfolio in a glance...

- "Car make and model classification from Image":
  - My BSc thesis which I experimented with CNNs for the first time 🧪 - [repository](https://github.com/AK2001/Car-Model-Classification-from-Image)

- A similarity search system build upon a SQL database containing millions of records
  - **Key Challenge**: Find a reliable way to sync the SQL database to the vector database
  - **My solution**: Create an automation which checks recently modified records --> process them --> adds/deletes/updates
  - **Tech Stack**: **Qdrant** (vector db), **FastAPI** (backend server), **Prefect** (workflow orchestration), **Hugging-Face** (embeddings)
